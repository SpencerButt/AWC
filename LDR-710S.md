# Lesson 1 - The Strategic Environment

## Introduction

We (Airmen) face a changing environment as we shift focus from low(er)-intensity conflict to **Great Power Competition** confronting adversaries such as *China* and *Russia*.

The **Great Power Competition** is an era of ***Strategic Competition***, and requires adoption of the *Accelerate Change or Lose* mindset of Gen Charles Q. Brown (USAF).

Amongst these changes are relationship-building, both internal and external to our organizations, services, departments, and even our nations. 

The **Great Power Competition** environment is:
* V: Volatile
* U: Uncertain
* C: Complex
* A: Ambiguous

## The VUCA Environment

The strategic environment is described as VUCA.
* V: Volatile
* U: Uncertain
* C: Complex
* A: Ambiguous

VUCA is what results when large agencies and organizations interact with one another in order to try and achieve a common objective. 

The *Strategic Leader* lives in the VUCA environment & understanding this environment and the leaders place within it is the first critical step for success.
