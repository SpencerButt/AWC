# Lesson 1 - The *Strategic* Environment

## Introduction

We (Airmen) face a changing environment as we shift focus from low(er)-intensity conflict to **Great Power Competition** confronting adversaries such as *China* and *Russia*.

The **Great Power Competition** is an era of ***Strategic Competition***, and requires adoption of the *Accelerate Change or Lose* mindset of Gen Charles Q. Brown (USAF).

Amongst these changes are relationship-building, both internal and external to our organizations, services, departments, and even our nations. 

The **Great Power Competition** environment is:
* V: Volatile
* U: Uncertain
* C: Complex
* A: Ambiguous

## The VUCA Environment

The strategic environment is described as VUCA.
* V: Volatile
* U: Uncertain
* C: Complex
* A: Ambiguous

VUCA is what results when large agencies and organizations interact with one another in order to try and achieve a common objective. 

The *Strategic Leader* lives in the VUCA environment & understanding this environment and the leaders place within it is the first critical step for success.

#### Chapter 1. Leadership at the Strategic Level

***Strategic Leadership***: The process of **aligning** people, systems, and resources to achieve a **vision** for the enterprise while **enabling** an adaptive and innovative culture necessary to gain an advantage in the competitive **environment**.

Aligning and enabling activities must account for the past

Achieving a vision of the future well beyond the time horizons considered by tactical or operational leaders

To succeed at the strategic level leaders must:
1. understand the breadth, scope, and complexity of the environment in which they operate 
	 The strategic-leader operating environment is competitive and resists conclusive analysis and permanent solutions 
	 The competitive environment is a network of complex, adaptive systems that involve deep uncertainty resulting from interconnections of systems, subsystems, and their agents 
	 The interconnections between systems and subsystems are not fully known 
	 Small actions can have massive, unpredicted effects on the entire environment making risk assessment difficult
2. appreciate the magnitude of the potential costs of their decisions
	 The potential costs in blood and treasure of the decisions that strategic leaders make is so much higher, that failure can completely change the nature of a nation's or its armed forces' participation in future conflict
3. leverage senior leadership teams
	1. Informational teams: provide a single venue where strategic leader can gather all necessary information to facilitate environmental scanning and ensure alignment of the organization's people, processes, technology, and structure
	2. Consultative teams: advise leaders about key decisions they must make
	3. Coordinating teams: empowered to coordinate as they execute important initiatives for the strategic leaders
	4. Decision-making teams: responsible for enabling executive decision making affecting the entire organization into the future
	Senior leaders use senior leadership teams to facilitate succession management
	Teams expand the capacity of strategic leaders		
4. operate as stewards of the profession, embracing both their responsibilities to lead the profession and manage the profession’s bureaucratic arm
	Strategic-leaders must be stewards of the profession
	Strategic-leaders must balance the force's expertise against the potential future operating environment
	Strategic-leaders must balance between organizational culture and its institutional practices
	Strategic-leaders have equal responsibility to lead both warfighting side of the profession and the profession's bureaucracy
	Leading bureaucracy entails communicating clear priorities and ensure the efficient application of resources to provided trained and ready forces for war
	Stewardship is about serving the needs of the nation 

Who is a strategic leader
	The most senior leaders in an organization and the large unit leaders and division chiefs within staffs.
	Upper echelons of organizations with vested personal responsibilities for exercising leadership on behalf on strategic leaders
	**Provide Vision** craft visions that describe idealized pictures of what their organization should strive to become. 
		Rely on contributions from leaders within the organization who help scan the environment and provide awareness of societal, international, technological, demographic, and economic developments impacting the organization
		Identify the important elements of both the environment and the organization that are not congruent with the vision
	**Aligning people, systems, and resources**
		Encompasses actions internal & external to the organization that strategic leaders take posture the organization to enact the strategy and to interact with the environment 
		Explicitly align ends (objectives), ways (concepts and methods) and means (resources) to ensure commitment in a manner that allows the organization to succeed in its current and future environment
		SLs must also work outside the organization to influence stakeholders (often senior or hold significant power), allocate resources to help achieve the vision, or remove or mitigate obstacles
	**Enabling an adaptive and innovative culture**
		SLs take *enabling actions* aimed at the informal aspects of the organization and help create conditions that encourage coordination and sharing of information and ideas among stakeholders
		The desired culture is both bottom-down and top-up
		SLs play a critical enabling role
#### Chapter 2. The Competitive Environment

Competition pervades the national security leadership environment

Competition in dynamic, characterized by persistent change as competitors strive to obtain and sustain competitive advantage

Competitive advantage in national security and defense manifests as unique or primary claim to valuable resources, control of or decisive influence over a crucial decision, or the power to compel, coerce or destroy an adversary

Competitive advantage occurs both internal and external to security organizations

Strategic competition occurs in complex, adaptative systems that resist conclusive analysis and defy permanent solution. These systems are structurally complex and dynamic, and behaviorally adaptive

Strategic Competition has three crucial characteristics:
1. Involves unresolvable uncertainty, meaning system behaviors and the actions of agents within the system cannot be described through stable or reliable measures of risk
2. National security competition takes divers forms, and occurs both inside and outside organizational boundaries
3. Participants have a role in shaping the terms of competition - rules, boundaries, players, and resources are both given by nature and defined by the competitors

Permanent solution(s) are not a natural state of strategic competition nor a legitimate goal of strategy - **we do not solve strategic competitive problems, we manage them**

Complex, adaptive systems generate adaptation to changing competitive conditions

Constant adaption creates opportunities for new paths to competitive advantage

The complexity of competitive systems arise from their structural and behavioral features. 
- Big in population/geography with diverse resources and agents
- Boundaries of complex adaptive systems are porous - agents and resources can enter and exit enabling constant change of the system
- Elements of complex adaptive systems are interconnected, highly networked structures, allowing resources to follow many different paths throughout the system, and for agents to correspond with other agents, and develop connections to new agents

There are no winners in strategic competition only **leaders**, **laggards**, and **losers** - all victories are temporary, with some more short-lived than others

**Leaders** -  Actors whose choices and recourse endowments put them in an advantageous position relative to competitors. Leaders have easier access to scarce resources and the ability to shape the collective understanding of the rules of the game
**Laggards** - Actors competing from a position of relative weakness (relative to leaders). They may be gaining, maintaining, or loosing ground to the leaders.
**Losers** - Are out of the strategic competition environment. Losing may be a temporary condition in strategic competition. 

Strategic competition involves **Unresolvable Uncertainty** referring to the lack of known (or knowable) probability distributions, consequently the behaviors of agents within such a system will not adhere to stable measures of risk. 

Good competitive strategies reduce uncertainty, but not eliminate it. There are two elements of strategic competition which are the source of strategic uncertainty, **Complexity**, and **Adaptation**
	**Complexity** makes optimum decision-making in strategic competition impossible.
		- Optimization requires perfect knowledge of the consequences (effects) of potential decisions (causes)
		- Optimization requires a perfect understanding of the `utility function` we derive from various possible future states to appropriate prioritize
		- Optimization requires exhaustive awareness of all possible options/paths to the future to select the best (optimum) way-ahead
Decision-making withing complex competitive systems involves 'satisficing' to find  the *good enough* criteria to derive decision making in the real-world
	The adaptive behavior of competitors ( **Adaptation**) makes certainty an impossibility in competitive decision making  

No amount of resource expenditure (time, money, manpower) can eliminate the analytical and strategic challenges posed by complex adaptive systems. 

The appropriate role of risk management in complex adaptive systems is to understand risk and reduce it where ever possible

***Scarcity*** is the one essential characteristic of all competition

Competition in national security is exceptionally diverse, occurring both inside and outside of organizational boundaries.

National security competition includes:
- violent competition with opposing forces
- roles and mission competition within the military and across the government
- budget competition within the DoD and across the government
- international competition

Internal competitions affect decisions for structuring and aligning people, processes, technology, and resources to achieve a strategic vision

External competition within the national security environment drives policy and decisions on the use of different instruments of national power to safeguard national interests and competitive standing

**Identity** concerns whether to approach another entity as a competitor, partner, or something else

**Involvement** concerns whether to compete, exit, or something in-between (monitor). Participation is not required, and players can exit from competition if desired

Strategic Leaders operating in complex adaptive system must concern themselves with obtaining and maintaining advantage. 
- All advantages are provisional
- Organizations exist to make routine the assumptions and activities that help them succeed, and those assumptions and activities sustain success until they no longer fit the competitive environment and they become weaknesses

#### Chapter 3. Leading Large Bureaucratic Organizations: The Internal Environment

**Three is a need for bureaucracy**
- the multiple systems and processes comprising a bureaucracy are essential for the large, complex, organizations like the DoD
	- Senior leaders depend on these systems because their size and complexity preclude their ability to know every part of the organization, to interact with every employee, and to hold people personally accountable
	- direct supervision and real-time situation awareness are impossible to obtain and maintain alone
	- administrative structures and systems are necessary to distribute, coordinate, and supervise activities of the major sub-organizations within bureaucracy
- bureaucracies are impersonal, favor no one, and seek to create efficiencies for the sake of the whole organization
Strategic leaders should design and maintain bureaucratic systems that enable (not hinder) achieving strategic goals

**Organizational Tensions**
In large, complex organizations there are persistent tensions that create difficult decisions for senior leaders. Ex:
- Balancing the opportunity costs of near-term objectives against more distance goals often focuses attention on incremental process efficiencies over long term plans
	- Shown in the focus on near-term readiness at the expense of modernization efforts (provide capabilities needed now, vs capabilities needed in the future fight)
- Balancing cost, schedule, and future performance within the major defense acquisition system
- Specialized objectives of individual sub-organizations and the overall goals of the enterprise
	- Creating specialized sub-organizations requires more effort and time to integrate those units within the enterprise
	- Additional sub-organizations require additional administrative burden and may create operational redundancy 
- As the need to manage environmental complexity increases, greater effort is required from the Strategic Leader to coordinate action and outputs across subunits

**Organization Structure**
Organizational structure provides an important insight into how previous strategic leaders have though about balancing organizational tensions. Examination of the governing systems and lines of authority reflect and reinforce deliberate designs for differentiating and integrating such military activities. 

Options for designing organizational structure include
- Functional purpose (service branches, USA, USSF, USAF, USN, USMC)
- Interdependent operations (functional combatant commands, USSTRATCOM, USCYBERCOM, USTRANSCOM, USSOCOM)
- Geographic Region (USSPACECOM, USNORTHCOM, USSOUTHCOM, USEUCOM, USAFRICOM, USINDOPACOM, USCENTCOM)

Options for designing organizational decision processes
- Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE)
- Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS)
- Defense Acquisition System (DAS)
Designed as a way to align military requirements (JCIDS) with strategy, to synch Congressional authorizations and appropriations (PPBE) and to develop and maintain capability (DAS) across massive number of internal and external stakeholders.

These are example of *robust* formal standardization and consequently increased amount of bureaucracy

Within bureaucratic organizations there are *informal* structures that the Senior Leaders cannot directly design or control. Informal organizations emerge from unplanned patterns of interaction and can be significantly influenced by individuals. 

Informal relationships create social systems that affect work and how people experience it

Informal organizations are an important source of social influence by meeting psychological needs of employees by personalizing the bureaucracy, and fulfilling social needs through friendships and trust networks

Effective leadership in a bureaucracy is limited by what the formal organization enables and what the informal organization collectively supports

An indicator of strategic leadership success is the alignment between an organization's formal and informal structures. Negative cultures are typically a symptom of weak alignment between the formal and informal structures within an organization

Effective strategic leaders quickly recognize the root cause of frictions between formal and informal organizational structure and use their authority to modify the administrative aspects of the system to encourage desired behavior and organizational outcomes

**Strategic Leadership: Levers of Control**
There are four concrete ways (*levers of control*) for leaders to adapt organizations and enable change, two formal and two informal.
- Formal levers - tie behavior to specific consequences through use of control systems (rewards, punishments, or evaluations). Use of formal position power to shape operational standards and define how to measure success.
	- Boundary Levers - Change the reporting relationships, authorities, and/or the formal processes that guide operations. These changes impose or re-draw boundaries around who makes decision and how resources/rewards are allocated
		- Denying a promotion
		- Changes to formal decision support system (PPBE)
		- Issuing new doctrine/policy guidance
	- Diagnostic Levers - Change what is measured, adjusting milestones, or revising standards. Provide incentives to redirect efforts, and provide feedback about where results are not being achieved
- Informal levers - inspire people to follow rather than compel action.
	- Belief System Levers - directly address why people believe in the organization and what they believe about how it works. Leaders impact beliefs via the consistency in their own behaviors that model and communicate the core values and vision of the enterprise. By choosing to interact more around certain issues than others, leaders send direct and indirect messages about their (and organizational) priorities.
	- Interactive Lever - Refers to the idea that every action or inaction of a senior leader is interpreted by those below them in the hierarchy. Where and when strategic leaders decide to become personally involved, and what they focus on, shapes and focuses the attention of efforts across the enterprise. 

Leaders should consider the mix of levers they chose to pull. Both informal and formal levers are effective when applied appropriately. 

Senior leaders tend to often over rely on formal levers/use them in a reactionary way

Formal levers are top-down, informal levers are bottom-up control mechanisms

**Implications**
Strategic leadership of a complex system requires a depth of patience, resilience, foresight, and the character required to look beyond immediate events and to anticipate how decisions will be received by diverse stakeholders. This requires sophisticated intellectual understanding of second- and third-order consequences of decisions, and highly refined communication skills to meaningfully explain the trade-offs in decisions that may favor some groups over others yet move the enterprise toward strategic objectives.

#### Chapter 4. Competitive Strategy
Competitive systems require strategies for making choices

**Strategy - are guidelines for decision-making in conditions of competitive uncertainty, with the purpose of reducing that uncertainty and creating or maintaining an advantage**

Competitive strategies prioritize and balance contradictions over time, space, and scale. All strategy is based on expectations of a causal relationship between an action and a desired (or undesired) effect

Competitive Strategy Categories
- Deliberate or Emergent
- Direct or Indirect
- Based on Limited or Unlimited Resources
- Can involve competition based on quality, quantity, or a mix

**Ways of Competing**
- Deliberate - reflect a heroic view of competition in which leaders survey the environment and build and implement strategies. They produce an ordered result that reflects the will of the key decision-makers in an organization. Tend to be top-down or centralized
		- Controlled, conscious, and formal processes, decomposed into distinct steps
		- Place responsibility for the overall process with the chief executive
		- Produce fully-formed strategies that are implemented through detailed attentions to objectives, budgets, programs etc. 
	- Active Deliberate - Proactive and involve taking the initiative by making choices that start new chains of causation. 
	- Passive Deliberate - Reactive and involve making choices to frustrate, delay, or break the chain of causation that your adversary is budling. Tend to have less control over timing and are more reactive
- Emergent - Display unintentional order that arise from patterns of decision-maker over time, and order is not clear until after the fact. Tend to be bottom-up  or decentralized, and occur through learning
	- Assumes that the complex and dynamic nature of the organization's environment:
		- precludes deliberate control
		- strategy making must above all take the form of a process of learning over time in which at the limit formulation and implementation become indistinguishable
	- Responsibility for strategy learning and development throughout the organization - many potential strategists
	- Leaders responsible for managing a process of strategic learning
	- Finds strategies first as patterns out of the past, and only later perhaps as deliberate plans for the future
	Emergent and Deliberate strategies are not mutually exclusive and organizations use each one at distinct stages of competition

- Direct - Tend to focus within levels of national security strategy. Make the enemy helpless to resist by physically destroying their military capabilities
- Indirect - Tend to focus across levels of national strategy. Convince the enemy that accepting our terms will be less painful than continuing to aggress or resist
	- More complex and time consuming
	- Connections between cause and effect are longer with greater risks of miscalculation and error
1. Indirect strategies are most evident in a willingness to accept a competitive disadvantage at one level in pursuit of a competitive advantage at a higher level
2. One competitor can employ a direct strategy while its opponent employs an indirect strategy
3. Indirect strategies can become direct when an adversary 'levels up' its own strategy

- Strategies of Quality - Focus on differentiation seeking overmatch. Product differentiation in terms of business competition
- Strategies of Quantity - Focus on mass. Cost differentiation in terms of business competition

**Competitive Narratives**
The stories we tell about strategic competition can be as powerful as the facts themselves

At the strategic level the meaning we give to reality differs based on how we collectively interpret it - how we socially construct it

Strategy does not merely need to orchestrate tactical actions (use of force) but also construct the interpretive structure which gives them meaning and links them to the end of policy

Leaders get influence, if not outright define, the meaning of reality. Recognizing the constructive possibilities of strategy can dramatically expand strategic choice and give rise to more creative strategies

The social construction of knowledge means that the social environment, with its relationships, culture, norms, and values, significantly influences how we understand the world, and how we understand the world affects what we know to be true

In a socially constructed context, a leader has maneuver space to shape the meaning of facts, and therefore transform our understanding of reality.

Transforming leaders do not change the facts; they change what the facts mean by constructing new possibilities

Though leaders cannot, on their own, successfully advance a strategic narrative, they have freedom to create and preserve options domestically and internationally by creatively interpreting established facts.

**Conclusion**
Effective organizational leadership is the essential condition of competitive success

### Reading 2 - The Strategic Environment
- The process of strategic leadership and decision making starts with an assessment of the environment
- Strategy is '*plan-like*' but **broader in scale, long term** in nature, and **surrounded by more uncertainties** 
- Organizational strategic choices may be limited by environmental constraints
- Successful strategic decisions will, by accident or design, shape the future conditions and the competitive advantaged enjoyed by the organization at that time

#### Model of How Environment Prompts Strategic Decisions
- **Competitive Advantage** - An attribute of an organization, institution, or nation, that enables it to compete more effectively for resources, and thus to survive
	- strategic organizations, institutions, and nations operate within open systems
	- strategic organizations as a part of open systems, are dependent on resources for survival
	- strategic organizations must compete for resources 
	- Competition for resources begins with a **strategic scan**
##### Strategic Scan Steps
1. Scan forward
2. create estimates that enable identification of long-range goals
3. implement courses of action designed to gain competitive advantage
   
- The national security strategy sets the plan to achieve the objectives that will provide a high level of security for the nation and its citizens ****in the long term****
- **Key Questions about the Strategic Environment**
	- Who are the major competitors
	- How competitive is the organization for the long-term, why?
	- What enhances/distracts from the organizations long term competitiveness
	- What is the organization doing for strategic planning to remove obstacles and exploit advantages
	- What are the resource problems for the future - what is the plan to deal with them
	- What are the threats to long-term survival
**Frame of Reference** - strategic decision makers gain a sense of the dynamic forces in the operating environment - applicable history coupled with the reflection needed to examine the flow of events over time in order to understand the cause and effect linkages to operations
**test** - Conceptual skill and openness to evaluate the historical frame of reference over time to ensure it is still representative of the real world (current operational environment)

**Barriers to Accurate Strategic Scans**
- Strategic leaders personal views 
- Strategic leader holding stake in the outcome of decisions
- Personal values of the strategic decision maker (self-esteem, hurting career prospects, loosing support of key constituents)
##### VUCA Barriers to Decision Making Process
The Strategic Decision Making process must deal with the VUCA barriers

**Robust System** - Capacity for timely system change. Either anticipate or adapt to environmental change to maintain competitive advantage

- Volatility - rate of environmental change
	- Volatility arises from the competitive nature of the world and the competition for finite resources
	- The challenge to strategic leaders, to their leadership and decision making processes is increasing at a critical pace
- Uncertainty - unpredictability of change
	- Uncertainty results from both the complexity of systems and subsystems at the strategic level and from the incomplete knowledge about the current situation
	- The rate of change in the global environment and uncertainty about what the effects of known changes are likely to be cause uncertainty
	- competitors also seek to conceal their actions and intentions adding to uncertainty
	- Strategic leadership and decision making must resolve uncertainty (to the maximum possible extent) by penetrating an adversaries actions to conceal/confuse 
- Complexity - intricacy of key decision factors
	- cause and effect relationships are difficult to see and asses. 
	- there are many causes and many divergent effects exists
	- many-linked cause and effect chains exist in the strategic environment
	- The challenge to strategic leadership is twofold
		- a frame of reference or perspective that is dynamic enough for the decision maker to recognize, understand, and explain to others; and,
		- a leader's mastery of decision tools and processes that enable them to bring a broader set of perspectives than just their own into the decision making process
- Ambiguity - vagueness about the current situation and potential outcomes
	- Exists when a given event or situation can be interpreted in more than one way
	- May also exist because the intentions of other actors in the strategic environment bay either not be known or may be misinferred (by accident or by adversary design)
	- The challenge to strategic leadership is recognizing that the decision maker cannot have a 'stand-alone' perspective, and that effective strategic decisions must flow from a managed process that produces a perspective through consensus that is broader than any single person probably possesses
##### National Security Strategy
- VUCA are not independent concepts - each feed the other
- successful strategies must be compatible with the world that will form over the next three to four decades
- we are likely in the midst of the information age revolution that will transform the course of human history and make old paradigms useful for interpreting world events no longer applicable in the future-'information'-environment
- The challenge for strategic leadership is to understand the now-occurring dynamics of change and develop the clearest possible visualization of the end results of change with enough lead time to ensure a competitively advantageous position can be achieved

##### VUCA as a Base
- Coping with VUCA is the essence of strategic leadership
- VUCA requires understanding different cultures, different kinds of national objectives, and different means other nations employ to achieve their objectives
- Strategic leadership must be based on a broader frame of reference 

### Reading 3 - *Managing Chaos in the Era of Great Power Competition*
* Title: Managing Chaos in the Era of Great Power Competition
* Author: Austin Long, Linda Robinson, Seth G. Jones
* Date: 5 Sep 2017
* Publisher: War on the Rocks

#### Thesis
- Three is a growing danger that U.S. national security strategy will focus too much on convectional aspects of great and regional power competition and neglect the importance of 'short-of-armed' conflict (grey zone)
- Today's world does not allow a single strategic focus
- As the U.S. revitalizes its conventional and nuclear deterrence capabilities it does not have the luxury of ignoring sub-state challenges. U.S. strategy that incorporates this fact could manage the chaos of the strategic environment at a reasonable cost
#### Threats to the U.S.
- The U.S. faces three distinct but interrelated security challenges
	1. Renewed competition with great powers (China & Russia)
		- Competition will focus on the nature of the international order
		- Competitors seek to alter the current order through
			- Force
			- Coercion
			- Influence Operations
	2. Regional challengers (Iran & North Korea)
		- Regional challengers lack the ability to shape the international order
		- These states reject America's role in their region
	3. Chaos within states (violent sub-state actors, terrorist organizations, militias, criminal gangs)
		- these actors feed on and sustain chaos inside states and regions
- U.S. strategy has neglected the connection between state-based challenges (China, Russia, North Korea, Iran) and that of sub-state actors
- U.S. policy is failing to address the wider challenge of sub-state threats with the exception of some acute threats (Islamic State / Houthis in Yemen)

#### Boundaries between Security Challenges
- Boundaries between great powers, regional challengers, and sub-state actors are fluid, or non-existent
	- Cold War era conventional and nuclear deterrence and containment of the Soviet Union drove competition into 'gray zone' competition
	- marked by great-power use of sub-state actors by both sides to achieve strategic competition goals 
- Regional challengers make extensive use of sub-state actors
- Resources (dollars, manpower, etc) spent on sub-state actor threats, pull from resources that could be used to fund competition against adversary great power competitors 
- U.S. strategy must balance the need to address sub-state actors with great-power competitors 
##### Guidelines for U.S. Strategy to Address Sub-State Actors
1. U.S. defense strategy needs to more fully prepare for unconventional competition with state adversaries. U.S. Special Operations Forces can play an essential role in countering unconventional strategies and tactics by great powers and regional competitors.
2. U.S. defense strategy must be integrated within a whole-of-government interagency approach. Military measures to counter threats are necessary, but will not be effective if they are not integrated with capabilities that exist beyond the DoD. 
	- Adversaries are playing a multifaceted game that must be met with a similar sophisticated array of measures. 
	- Overreliance on costly military measures are a recipe for draining national coffers without definitive resolution of wide range for threats to U.S. interests.
3. Strategy should adopt a proactive, not reactive, stance toward the sub-state challenge
	- New sub-state groups are week and vulnerable to co-optation or coercion
	- Proactive and early 'operational preparation of the environment' can allow the U.S. to become aware of emerging challenges and deal with them before they become threats
4. Strategy should ensure long-term continuity in the individual teams at the operational and tactical level is crucial for managing sub-state actors in different regions and states to leverage the expertise and relationships that will produce results
5. Strategy should embrace U.S. allies, partners, and proxies to do the heavy lifting.
	- U.S. special operations community uses the maxim 'by, with, and through' 
	- Requires accepting that U.S. allies, partners, and proxies have their own interests and will not simply adopt U.S. objectives wholesale and without comment
6. Strategy should consider that commitments must remain limited and will produce limited, but valuable, results. Limited commitments add up on a global scale so strategists will likely have to prioritize some regions and assume risk in others

## Meta-Leadership Model
- Meta-leadership model aids strategic leaders in building resilient and flexible organizations, capable of connectivity and coordination with outside agencies in order to achieve overlapping missions with broad scopes
- Meta-leadership, however, builds cross-agency and cross-government coordination of strategy and effort
- Meta-leaders have a greater breadth of focus, encouraging people and organizations to extend beyond their traditional domains to achieve an extra-organizational outcome
- Meta-leaders must understand the drives and motivations present within other organizations - they also must be able to "speak the language" of other organizations, which requires a degree of cross-cultural competence in order to achieve a synergy of effort and to reduce the competition that often exists between organizations

#### Abstract
- Large organizations and the work they accomplish are becoming less hierarchical and more reliant on complex and inter-dependent connections with other entities. Leading in such an environment requires expanded thinking and activity beyond one’s formal bounds of authority. Meta-leadership is a theoretically robust and pragmatically useful evidence-based framework and practice method for generating widespread influence and cohesive action that expands the leader’s domain of engagement, leverage, and efficacy.

#### Introduction
- Modern organizations, marked by diverse workforces, dynamic and ubiquitous information systems, complex supply chains, strategic alliances, and outsourced resources, requires the transformation of the traditional leader 
- Modern strategic leadership requires the exercise of leadership across a network of entities with interactive, interdependent and creative processes within and outside one's own agency or firm- it is no longer a simple matter of leading within a well-defined hierarchy
- Leaders are challenged to use influence as much as or more than, formal authority - authority and accountability structures are more reciprocal and relational
- The best evidence of effective leadership in situations where leaders must catalyze action above and beyond their formal lines of decision-making and control is **unified commitment among all stakeholder** (internal and external to the leaders own organization) - 'connectivity'. To achieve, leaders exhibit ***Meta-Leadership*** by simultaneously
	- Lead down in the traditional sense
	- Up to the people or organizations to which they are accountable
	- Across to activate peer groups and others within their organization with whom there is no formal subordinate relationship
	- Beyond to entities outside the leader's organization or chain of command
- Meta-Leadership addresses leadership challenges that cross inter- and intra-organizational boundaries as well as those found within hierarchical structures
#### The Model of Meta-Leadership: Origins and Extensions 
- Failures of rigidly hierarchical organization structures underscore the need for incorporation of more flexible, adaptive, and integrative styles - meta-leadership
- 'Meta' is applied to systematically identify cross-cutting themes found in many different leadership styles, and combining and synthesizing findings about a range of leadership questions in search of overarching thinking and conclusions
- Meta-Leadership connects what have otherwise been disparate areas of inquiry about leadership into a cohesive, interdepended framework

#### Output vs. Input and Throughput
- The output (or product) of leadership is as important as input (individual competencies), and throughput - Meta-Leaders seek to achieve results that cannot be accomplished by one organization, unit, or department - typically their own - in isolation
- Broad, consequential objectives both appeal and require participation by people who work in entirely different organizations, and/or levels of a hierarchical framework. By linking the efforts of the numerous organizations/actors and many disconnected organizational units, the meta-leader, operating without direct or explicit authority, leverages and integrates their activities to accomplish something - an output - that not would otherwise be achievable

#### Dimensions of Meta-Leadership: Design, Concept, and Practice
- Meta-Leadership is not a new theory of leadership
- Meta-Leadership is a framework that helps organize, integrate, and make more useful relevant insights from the large volumes of leadership analysis, practice, and scholarship
- Meta-Leadership framework provides three important advantages
	1. A conceptual framework and common vocabulary that describes intentional networking and cohesion within, across and beyond formal organizational boundaries to connect the purposes of work of different stakeholders
	2. A purposeful strategy for action to advance coordinated planning and activity
	3. A compelling mission and rallying cry for both leaders and followers that inspires, guides, and instructs, setting a higher standard and expectation for performance and impact
- Meta-Leadership addresses the complexities of generating a unity of action when many different constituencies must be focused into a broadly adopted strategy, plan, or mission even if their priorities and proclivities are conflicting - best aligning mission, strategy, tactics, and success metrics with the problem or opportunity
- There are three dimensions of meta-leadership practice:
	1. Person - represents the leadership capacity
	2. Situation - an accurate perception constituting the leadership context
	3. Connectivity - organizational or interpersonal capability: 
		- *down* formal purview of authority
		- *up* to those to whom one is accountable
		- *across* to other departments/units/teams within the organization
		- *beyond* to the various entities outside the organization
- The intent of the meta-leadership framework and practice method is to draw different perspectives into a pragmatic, unified model
#### Dimension One: The Person of the Meta-Leader
- Meta-Leaders must have a high degree of emotional intelligence and the ability to process emotional intelligence in order to better navigate the social environment
	- Self-awareness has been shown to correlate with leadership effectiveness
	- Self-discipline, drive, understanding, and a capacity to from meaningful and satisfying relationships are critical in the effort to cross the usual divides and boundaries of organizational, professional, and cultural association
	- Meta-Leaders strive to take actions that will achieve the greatest commitment from a wide scope of stakeholders, including those outside the formal chain of command. 
	- Organizational cohesion in high-stress situations has been found to be lacking when trust-based relationships are absent
- Meta-Leaders need to filter large, complex problems through a wide range of possible solutions
	- They view situations as complex, adaptive systems where patterns of connections, dependencies, and interdependencies are better sources of understanding system behavior than is a focus on the individual components or actors
	- Meta-Leaders have aptitude for using self- and situational insight for seeing the bigger picture particularly in fast-changing and emotionally charged situations
#### Dimension Two: The Situation
- The task of diagnosing and communicating the leadership context - what is happening -  is among the most difficult and most critical in any complex situation/crisis
- Finding an appropriate solution depends first on precisely determining what is occurring
- Difficulty due to the existence in the gap between objective reality and subjective assessment of the situation at hand
- The greater the complexity, the more difficult it is to develop an evidence-based, clear, and actionable description of what is occurring and derive the most appropriate response
- In a complex situation, a quick assessment that is close to the mark and moves the process forward is better than a slow, though more accurate, one that comes comes to late to make a difference - even if there are risks associated with premature decision-making
- A tool to enable leaders to hone their understanding and to build on decisions already made and actions already taken is the *POP-DOC Loop*
	1. Perceive - opening one's mental aperture to gather as much data as possible
	2. Orient - Narrow the aperture as patterns appear and make it possible to separate relevant from irrelevant data
	3. Predict - Use identified patters to anticipate the trajectory of events and generate options
	4. Decide - Commit to a course of action
	5. Operationalize - Secure and deploy sufficient resources to carry out the decision
	6. Communicate - Ensure all relevant stakeholders know what is happening, what they can expect, what is expected of them, and pull in information useful in reassessing the situation and what can be done about it

	- POP-DOC loop can, and should, be traversed multiple times as the situation unfolds
#### Dimension Three: Connectivity 
- Meta-Leadership requires moving stakeholders from individual self-interests to shared aligned interests
- Leaders must build unity of mission and craft a strategic view of who needs to be involved and what will motivate individual participation
- Individuals motivated by vision and message are inspired and empowered to reach beyond the confines of their particular role
- Embedding connections institutionally ensures they continue to exist beyond the tenure of the individuals involved
- People-to-people and organization-to-organization connections overcome barriers and gaps imposed by strict silo thinking
- Building connectivity between persons and organizations does not required removing silos, instead the silos become semi-permeable membranes ensuring information and resources can flow to foster overall system function
- **Distinct Facets of Connectivity Meta-Leadership**
	1. Leading Down - traditional leadership to one's formal subordinates
	2. Leading Up 
		- Being able to effectively influence those to whom one is accountable
		- Careful cultivation and management of the productive relationship with superior(s) may lead to as much or more power and influence as the superior
		- Meta-Leaders help the superior focus on priority objectives and advances the organization toward key goals with personal costs or benefits as a secondary consideration 
	3. Leading Across
		- Refers to relationships with other departments or organizational-units within the same authority framework, or intra-organizational engagements
		- Effective 'leading-across' generates a common, yet complex, thread of interests and involvement among entities that look at challenges from distinct and complementary vantage points
		- Aligning assets and interests across inter-organizational units activates more than what any one organizational unit can do on its own
		- Meta-Leader should focus attention on the shared opportunity while tempering forces of suspicion and jealousy that constrain achievement
		- Leader must identify and understand the individual intrinsic motives of different stakeholders - each entity must be recognized by their own unique profile of interests, experiences, and contributions to the shared enterprise
		- Meta-Leader knows action and early triumphs are a critical factor in demonstrating the value added of working together
		- Cohesion between organizational-units must be embedded into the thinking and activity of units and people - it can't begin the moment of decision and action
		- Designing and building cross-system action linkages must be a strategic and intentional effort by which both the process and outcome of the effort attest to the benefits of working toward common purposes
	4. Leading Beyond
		- Refers to relationships to other departments or organizational-units related without an overarching power/authority framework, governance structure, nor common chief executive - This is influence in the absence of overarching authority
		- It is up to the Meta-Leader to foster a solution-oriented direction and interest-based negotiation between organizations
		- Meta-Leader must convincingly make the case that the combined objectives are best achieved through connectivity of effort and then guide the process to successfully achieve the desired end state
#### On Being a Meta-Leader
- Meta-Leaders take a wider, system-level view of both opportunities and challenges with an emphasis on broader constituencies of followers essential to success *no mater to whom they report*
- Leadership effectiveness is defined as "people follow you" by their own volition
- Meta-Leaders convincingly define a higher purpose - making the case that by acting across and beyond the confines of their own organizational entities, the component participants will accomplish more and function with less friction, thereby deriving the collective benefits of the combined enterprise 
- The Meta-Leader's vision and the process charted so compelling that others follow
- Two Aspects of Leadership Equation to create a broad expanse of influence
	- Traditional hierarchical leadership - the primary source of recognition and authority
	- Social Movement Leadership - advocate exercise to inspire and engage people without explicit authority to persuade followership. Blend of commitment to a purpose, charisma, and talent to motivate
#### Conclusion
- The command-and-control model does not uniformly fit into the Meta-Leadership framework
- In Meta-Leadership, organizations are more distributed
- Meta-Leadership is a framework and practice model well-suited to situations that are built on trust and influence more than formal authority

#### Abstract
- **Effective emergency preparedness and response requires leadership that can accomplish perceptive coordination and communication amongst diverse agencies and sectors**. Nevertheless, operating within their specified scope of authority, preparedness leaders in characteristic bureaucratic fashion often serve to bolster the profile and import of their own organization, thereby creating a silo effect that interferes with effective systemwide planning and response. This ***article describes a strategy to overcome traditional silo thinking: “meta-leadership,” overarching leadership that intentionally connects the purposes and work of different organizations or organizational units***. Thinking and operating beyond their immediate scope of authority, **meta-leaders provide guidance, direction, and momentum across organizational lines that develop into a shared course of action and a commonality of purpose among people and agencies that are doing what may appear to be very different work**. Meta-leaders are able to imaginatively and effectively leverage system assets, information, and capacities, a particularly critical function for organizations with emergency preparedness, a particularly critical function for organizations with emergency preparedness responsibilities that are constrained by ingrained bureaucratic patterns of behavior

#### Introduction
- Recent attempts at implementing coordination of resources across agencies have led to changes in organizational form and mandate - but the hoped-for change in behavior has been lagging
- Silo/stovepipe effect of distinct and deeply ingrained bureaucratic cultures, budgets, and career ascendancy compels government agencies toward self-protectiveness, insularity, and allegiance to their own agency-based advocacy and independence.
	- There remain long-standing traditions of rivalry and palpable struggles for control, especially among organizations with similar or overlapping missions and scope of responsibility

#### An Expanded Nomenclature for Leadership: Meta-Leadership
- Commonly understood leadership works to build capacity within an organization
- Meta-Leadership is intended to extend the common leadership definition to achieve cross-agency coordination of strategy and effort required for nation-state solutions
	- 'Meta' used to refer to overarching leadership that connects the purpose and the work of different organizations or organizational units
	- Meta-Leadership refers to guidance, direction, and momentum across organizational lines that develop into a shared course of action and a commonality of purpose among people and agencies that are doing what appears to be very different work
	- Meta-Leaders are able to influence and accomplish such collaboration of effort across organizations - multi-jurisdictional, multi-agency, and public-private
	- Meta-Leaders connect with, influence, and integrate the activities of diverse agencies, thereby motivating interaction, enhancing communication, and engendering cross-organizational confidence necessary for effective national-level problem solving
- Meta-Leaders display the ability to:
	- Legitimately and productively reach beyond their scope of authority and responsibility and, in the process, are able to generate linkages of purpose and activity that amplify their outcome and impact
	- Leverage information and recourses across agencies extending what any unit alone could accomplish, by reducing interagency friction and creating a synergy of progress
- Connectivity among agencies, organizations, and people with complementary missions is one by-product of meta-leadership
#### Organizational Leadership and System Meta-Leadership: Commonalities and Distinctions
- Power / Authority
	- Traditional leaders derive power and influence form their formal job descriptions and authority
	- Meta-Leaders seek to influence in other organizations thorough effective negotiation and the development of personal and organizational credibility that crosses organizational lines
		- Meta-Leaders may achieve connectivity by purchasing it - through a business deal or memorandum of understanding - as part of a contractual deal between organizations
		- More difficult when the meta-leader is advocating for common goals that offer no direct compensation
		- More difficult when the desired shared purpose requires sacrifice (reduction of autonomy or independence, change in operating procedure) of an external organization
		- Most difficult to accomplish connectivity involving new relationships between traditionally competitive agencies
- Organizational Direction
	- Traditional leaders are responsible for steering the course of their own organization
	- Meta-Leaders must chart a new course in coordination with a range of other agencies outside the purview of prior organizational experience or responsibility
- Organizational Familiarity
	- Traditional leaders most often function (feel at ease) within the confines of their conventional work/silos
	- Meta-Leaders must feel at ease acting when engaging with people/organizations beyond their professional domain or expertise 
		- Must also enable external actors to feel at ease working in the Meta-Leaders organization
	- Meta-Leaders must absorb and credibly apply concepts, facts, and vocabulary particular to other fields to better promote connectivity of effort
- Relative Breadth of Focus and Intercession
	- Traditional leaders work within organizations that authorize and condone their leadership
	- Meta-Leadership requires leaders operate without the benefit of established authority, precedent, and consensus on what should be done or how it should be accomplished 
	- Meta-Leadership thrives in the creation of something new and mission driven
#### The Art and Practice of Meta-Leadership: Unique Skills, Capacities, and Perspectives
- The art of Meta-Leadership derives from the capacity to envision a new connectivity of strategy and effort and then to communicate, inspire, and persuade broader participation
- Meta-Leadership is creative and **transformational** 
- Meta-Leaders, through their behavior and actions are able to motivate people to follow along - requires exceptional talent 
- Meta-Leaders appreciate the distinct values, goals, motives, and missions of the different organizational silos within the enterprise
- Meta-Leaders connect disparate groups by aligning core interests and motivations, redefining success as a product of combined action and interaction of the multiple organizations in coordinated synchronization - each of the organizations recognizes that its individual success is derived in some measure form the success of the whole endeavor
- Meta-Leaders are able to persuade others to be motivated by an enlarged vision for what needs to be done and how it can be achieved
- Meta-Leader engages imaginative multidimensional problem solving by looking at a problem and its considerations from all key angles and organizations
- Key questions
	- Who are the key stakeholders and how do they define the problem
	- What are each of the unique interests and perspectives on the relevant challenge or question
	- What must be accomplished, both for the individual organizations as well as the larger cross-enterprise problem
- Multidimensional problem solving requires exquisite 'situational awareness' and an expert in accurate and efficient data collection, analysis, and packaging of information into strategic themes of action and interaction suitable for presentation in a form/format that has wide applicability and meaning for the intended audience
- **Meta-Leaders are able to get people on board by helping them make sense of widely cast and disparate information, putting it into a coherent message that serves to unite people whom the meta-leader must recruit as followers**
#### Conclusion: Meat-Leadership and National Emergency Preparedness Strategy
- Meta-Leaders are able to 
	- effectively span organizations and weave important connections amongst them
	- incorporate the tone of critical thinking and perspective
	- deepen the understanding and work of national preparedness (and other national-level problem sets)
