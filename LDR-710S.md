# Lesson 1 - The Strategic Environment

## Introduction

We (Airmen) face a changing environment as we shift focus from low(er)-intensity conflict to **Great Power Competition** confronting adversaries such as *China* and *Russia*.

The **Great Power Competition** is an era of ***Strategic Competition***, and requires adoption of the *Accelerate Change or Lose* mindset of Gen Charles Q. Brown (USAF).

Amongst these changes are relationship-building, both internal and external to our organizations, services, departments, and even our nations. 

The **Great Power Competition** environment is:
* V: Volatile
* U: Uncertain
* C: Complex
* A: Ambiguous

## The VUCA Environment

The strategic environment is described as VUCA.
* V: Volatile
* U: Uncertain
* C: Complex
* A: Ambiguous

VUCA is what results when large agencies and organizations interact with one another in order to try and achieve a common objective. 

The *Strategic Leader* lives in the VUCA environment & understanding this environment and the leaders place within it is the first critical step for success.

#### Chapter 1. Leadership at the Strategic Level

***Strategic Leadership***: The process of **aligning** people, systems, and resources to achieve a **vision** for the enterprise while **enabling** an adaptive and innovative culture necessary to gain an advantage in the competitive **environment**.

Aligning and enabling activities must account for the past

Achieving a vision of the future well beyond the time horizons considered by tactical or operational leaders

To succeed at the strategic level leaders must:
1. understand the breadth, scope, and complexity of the environment in which they operate 
	 The strategic-leader operating environment is competitive and resists conclusive analysis and permanent solutions 
	 The competitive environment is a network of complex, adaptive systems that involve deep uncertainty resulting from interconnections of systems, subsystems, and their agents 
	 The interconnections between systems and subsystems are not fully known 
	 Small actions can have massive, unpredicted effects on the entire environment making risk assessment difficult
2. appreciate the magnitude of the potential costs of their decisions
	 The potential costs in blood and treasure of the decisions that strategic leaders make is so much higher, that failure can completely change the nature of a nation's or its armed forces' participation in future conflict
3. leverage senior leadership teams
	1. Informational teams: provide a single venue where strategic leader can gather all necessary information to facilitate environmental scanning and ensure alignment of the organization's people, processes, technology, and structure
	2. Consultative teams: advise leaders about key decisions they must make
	3. Coordinating teams: empowered to coordinate as they execute important initiatives for the strategic leaders
	4. Decision-making teams: responsible for enabling executive decision making affecting the entire organization into the future
	Senior leaders use senior leadership teams to facilitate succession management
	Teams expand the capacity of strategic leaders		
4. operate as stewards of the profession, embracing both their responsibilities to lead the profession and manage the professionâ€™s bureaucratic arm
	Strategic-leaders must be stewards of the profession
	Strategic-leaders must balance the force's expertise against the potential future operating environment
	Strategic-leaders must balance between organizational culture and its institutional practices
	Strategic-leaders have equal responsibility to lead both warfighting side of the profession and the profession's bureaucracy
	Leading bureaucracy entails communicating clear priorities and ensure the efficient application of resources to provided trained and ready forces for war
	Stewardship is about serving the needs of the nation 

Who is a strategic leader
	The most senior leaders in an organization and the large unit leaders and division chiefs within staffs.
	Upper echelons of organizations with vested personal responsibilities for exercising leadership on behalf on strategic leaders
	**Provide Vision** craft visions that describe idealized pictures of what their organization should strive to become. 
		Rely on contributions from leaders within the organization who help scan the environment and provide awareness of societal, international, technological, demographic, and economic developments impacting the organization
		Identify the important elements of both the environment and the organization that are not congruent with the vision
	**Aligning people, systems, and resources**
		Encompasses actions internal & external to the organization that strategic leaders take posture the organization to enact the strategy and to interact with the environment 
		Explicitly align ends (objectives), ways (concepts and methods) and means (resources) to ensure commitment in a manner that allows the organization to succeed in its current and future environment
		SLs must also work outside the organization to influence stakeholders (often senior or hold significant power), allocate resources to help achieve the vision, or remove or mitigate obstacles
	**Enabling an adaptive and innovative culture**
		SLs take *enabling actions* aimed at the informal aspects of the organization and help create conditions that encourage coordination and sharing of information and ideas among stakeholders
		The desired culture is both bottom-down and top-up
		SLs play a critical enabling role
#### Chapter 2. The Competitive Environment

Competition pervades the national security leadership environment

Competition in dynamic, characterized by persistent change as competitors strive to obtain and sustain competitive advantage

Competitive advantage in national security and defense manifests as unique or primary claim to valuable resources, control of or decisive influence over a crucial decision, or the power to compel, coerce or destroy an adversary

Competitive advantage occurs both internal and external to security organizations

Strategic competition occurs in complex, adaptative systems that resist conclusive analysis and defy permanent solution. These systems are structurally complex and dynamic, and behaviorally adaptive

Strategic Competition has three crucial characteristics:
1. Involves unresolvable uncertainty, meaning system behaviors and the actions of agents within the system cannot be described through stable or reliable measures of risk
2. National security competition takes divers forms, and occurs both inside and outside organizational boundaries
3. Participants have a role in shaping the terms of competition - rules, boundaries, players, and resources are both given by nature and defined by the competitors

Permanent solution(s) are not a natural state of strategic competition nor a legitimate goal of strategy - **we do not solve strategic competitive problems, we manage them**

Complex, adaptive systems generate adaptation to changing competitive conditions

Constant adaption creates opportunities for new paths to competitive advantage

The complexity of competitive systems arise from their structural and behavioral features. 
- Big in population/geography with diverse resources and agents
- Boundaries of complex adaptive systems are porous - agents and resources can enter and exit enabling constant change of the system
- Elements of complex adaptive systems are interconnected, highly networked structures, allowing resources to follow many different paths throughout the system, and for agents to correspond with other agents, and develop connections to new agents

There are no winners in strategic competition only **leaders**, **laggards**, and **losers** - all victories are temporary, with some more short-lived than others

**Leaders** -  Actors whose choices and recourse endowments put them in an advantageous position relative to competitors. Leaders have easier access to scarce resources and the ability to shape the collective understanding of the rules of the game
**Laggards** - Actors competing from a position of relative weakness (relative to leaders). They may be gaining, maintaining, or loosing ground to the leaders.
**Losers** - Are out of the strategic competition environment. Losing may be a temporary condition in strategic competition. 

Strategic competition involves **Unresolvable Uncertainty** referring to the lack of known (or knowable) probability distributions, consequently the behaviors of agents within such a system will not adhere to stable measures of risk. 

Good competitive strategies reduce uncertainty, but not eliminate it. There are two elements of strategic competition which are the source of strategic uncertainty, **Complexity**, and **Adaptation**
	**Complexity** makes optimum decision-making in strategic competition impossible.
		- Optimization requires perfect knowledge of the consequences (effects) of potential decisions (causes)
		- Optimization requires a perfect understanding of the `utility function` we derive from various possible future states to appropriate prioritize
		- Optimization requires exhaustive awareness of all possible options/paths to the future to select the best (optimum) way-ahead
Decision-making withing complex competitive systems involves 'satisficing' to find  the *good enough* criteria to derive decision making in the real-world
	The adaptive behavior of competitors ( **Adaptation**) makes certainty an impossibility in competitive decision making  

No amount of resource expenditure (time, money, manpower) can eliminate the analytical and strategic challenges posed by complex adaptive systems. 

The appropriate role of risk management in complex adaptive systems is to understand risk and reduce it where ever possible

***Scarcity*** is the one essential characteristic of all competition

Competition in national security is exceptionally diverse, occurring both inside and outside of organizational boundaries.

National security competition includes:
- violent competition with opposing forces
- roles and mission competition within the military and across the government
- budget competition within the DoD and across the government
- international competition

Internal competitions affect decisions for structuring and aligning people, processes, technology, and resources to achieve a strategic vision

External competition within the national security environment drives policy and decisions on the use of different instruments of national power to safeguard national interests and competitive standing

**Identity** concerns whether to approach another entity as a competitor, partner, or something else

**Involvement** concerns whether to compete, exit, or something in-between (monitor). Participation is not required, and players can exit from competition if desired

Strategic Leaders operating in complex adaptive system must concern themselves with obtaining and maintaining advantage. 
- All advantages are provisional
- Organizations exist to make routine the assumptions and activities that help them succeed, and those assumptions and activities sustain success until they no longer fit the competitive environment and they become weaknesses
