# Lesson 1 - The Strategic Environment

## Introduction

We (Airmen) face a changing environment as we shift focus from low(er)-intensity conflict to **Great Power Competition** confronting adversaries such as *China* and *Russia*.

The **Great Power Competition** is an era of ***Strategic Competition***, and requires adoption of the *Accelerate Change or Lose* mindset of Gen Charles Q. Brown (USAF).

Amongst these changes are relationship-building, both internal and external to our organizations, services, departments, and even our nations. 

The **Great Power Competition** environment is:
* V: Volatile
* U: Uncertain
* C: Complex
* A: Ambiguous

## The VUCA Environment

The strategic environment is described as VUCA.
* V: Volatile
* U: Uncertain
* C: Complex
* A: Ambiguous

VUCA is what results when large agencies and organizations interact with one another in order to try and achieve a common objective. 

The *Strategic Leader* lives in the VUCA environment & understanding this environment and the leaders place within it is the first critical step for success.

#### Chapter 1. Leadership at the Strategic Level

***Strategic Leadership***: The process of **aligning** people, systems, and resources to achieve a **vision** for the enterprise while **enabling** an adaptive and innovative culture necessary to gain an advantage in the competitive **environment**.

Aligning and enabling activities must account for the past

Achieving a vision of the future well beyond the time horizons considered by tactical or operational leaders

To succeed at the strategic level leaders must:
1. understand the breadth, scope, and complexity of the environment in which they operate 
	 The strategic-leader operating environment is competitive and resists conclusive analysis and permanent solutions 
	 The competitive environment is a network of complex, adaptive systems that involve deep uncertainty resulting from interconnections of systems, subsystems, and their agents 
	 The interconnections between systems and subsystems are not fully known 
	 Small actions can have massive, unpredicted effects on the entire environment making risk assessment difficult
2. appreciate the magnitude of the potential costs of their decisions
	 The potential costs in blood and treasure of the decisions that strategic leaders make is so much higher, that failure can completely change the nature of a nation's or its armed forces' participation in future conflict
3. leverage senior leadership teams
	1. Informational teams: provide a single venue where strategic leader can gather all necessary information to facilitate environmental scanning and ensure alignment of the organization's people, processes, technology, and structure
	2. Consultative teams: advise leaders about key decisions they must make
	3. Coordinating teams: empowered to coordinate as they execute important initiatives for the strategic leaders
	4. Decision-making teams: responsible for enabling executive decision making affecting the entire organization into the future
	Senior leaders use senior leadership teams to facilitate succession management
	Teams expand the capacity of strategic leaders		
4. operate as stewards of the profession, embracing both their responsibilities to lead the profession and manage the professionâ€™s bureaucratic arm
	Strategic-leaders must be stewards of the profession
	Strategic-leaders must balance the force's expertise against the potential future operating environment
	Strategic-leaders must balance between organizational culture and its institutional practices
	Strategic-leaders have equal responsibility to lead both warfighting side of the profession and the profession's bureaucracy
	Leading bureaucracy entails communicating clear priorities and ensure the efficient application of resources to provided trained and ready forces for war
	Stewardship is about serving the needs of the nation 

Who is a strategic leader
	The most senior leaders in an organization and the large unit leaders and division chiefs within staffs.
	Upper echelons of organizations with vested personal responsibilities for exercising leadership on behalf on strategic leaders
	**Provide Vision** craft visions that describe idealized pictures of what their organization should strive to become. 
		Rely on contributions from leaders within the organization who help scan the environment and provide awareness of societal, international, technological, demographic, and economic developments impacting the organization
		Identify the important elements of both the environment and the organization that are not congruent with the vision
	**Aligning people, systems, and resources**
		Encompasses actions internal & external to the organization that strategic leaders take posture the organization to enact the strategy and to interact with the environment 
		Explicitly align ends (objectives), ways (concepts and methods) and means (resources) to ensure commitment in a manner that allows the organization to succeed in its current and future environment
		SLs must also work outside the organization to influence stakeholders (often senior or hold significant power), allocate resources to help achieve the vision, or remove or mitigate obstacles
	**Enabling an adaptive and innovative culture**
		SLs take *enabling actions* aimed at the informal aspects of the organization and help create conditions that encourage coordination and sharing of information and ideas among stakeholders
		The desired culture is both bottom-down and top-up
		SLs play a critical enabling role
#### Chapter 2. The Competitive Environment

Competition pervades the national security leadership environment

Competition in dynamic, characterized by persistent change as competitors strive to obtain and sustain competitive advantage

Competitive advantage in national security and defense manifests as unique or primary claim to valuable resources, control of or decisive influence over a crucial decision, or the power to compel, coerce or destroy an adversary

Competitive advantage occurs both internal and external to security organizations

Strategic competition occurs in complex, adaptative systems that resist conclusive analysis and defy permanent solution. These systems are structurally complex and dynamic, and behaviorally adaptive

Strategic Competition has three crucial characteristics:
1. Involves unresolvable uncertainty, meaning system behaviors and the actions of agents within the system cannot be described through stable or reliable measures of risk
2. National security competition takes divers forms, and occurs both inside and outside organizational boundaries
3. Participants have a role in shaping the terms of competition - rules, boundaries, players, and resources are both given by nature and defined by the competitors

Permanent solution(s) are not a natural state of strategic competition nor a legitimate goal of strategy - **we do not solve strategic competitive problems, we manage them**

Complex, adaptive systems generate adaptation to changing competitive conditions

Constant adaption creates opportunities for new paths to competitive advantage

The complexity of competitive systems arise from their structural and behavioral features. 
- Big in population/geography with diverse resources and agents
- Boundaries of complex adaptive systems are porous - agents and resources can enter and exit enabling constant change of the system
- Elements of complex adaptive systems are interconnected, highly networked structures, allowing resources to follow many different paths throughout the system, and for agents to correspond with other agents, and develop connections to new agents

There are no winners in strategic competition only **leaders**, **laggards**, and **losers** - all victories are temporary, with some more short-lived than others

**Leaders** -  Actors whose choices and recourse endowments put them in an advantageous position relative to competitors. Leaders have easier access to scarce resources and the ability to shape the collective understanding of the rules of the game
**Laggards** - Actors competing from a position of relative weakness (relative to leaders). They may be gaining, maintaining, or loosing ground to the leaders.
**Losers** - Are out of the strategic competition environment. Losing may be a temporary condition in strategic competition. 

Strategic competition involves **Unresolvable Uncertainty** referring to the lack of known (or knowable) probability distributions, consequently the behaviors of agents within such a system will not adhere to stable measures of risk. 

Good competitive strategies reduce uncertainty, but not eliminate it. There are two elements of strategic competition which are the source of strategic uncertainty, **Complexity**, and **Adaptation**
	**Complexity** makes optimum decision-making in strategic competition impossible.
		- Optimization requires perfect knowledge of the consequences (effects) of potential decisions (causes)
		- Optimization requires a perfect understanding of the `utility function` we derive from various possible future states to appropriate prioritize
		- Optimization requires exhaustive awareness of all possible options/paths to the future to select the best (optimum) way-ahead
Decision-making withing complex competitive systems involves 'satisficing' to find  the *good enough* criteria to derive decision making in the real-world
	The adaptive behavior of competitors ( **Adaptation**) makes certainty an impossibility in competitive decision making  

No amount of resource expenditure (time, money, manpower) can eliminate the analytical and strategic challenges posed by complex adaptive systems. 

The appropriate role of risk management in complex adaptive systems is to understand risk and reduce it where ever possible

***Scarcity*** is the one essential characteristic of all competition

Competition in national security is exceptionally diverse, occurring both inside and outside of organizational boundaries.

National security competition includes:
- violent competition with opposing forces
- roles and mission competition within the military and across the government
- budget competition within the DoD and across the government
- international competition

Internal competitions affect decisions for structuring and aligning people, processes, technology, and resources to achieve a strategic vision

External competition within the national security environment drives policy and decisions on the use of different instruments of national power to safeguard national interests and competitive standing

**Identity** concerns whether to approach another entity as a competitor, partner, or something else

**Involvement** concerns whether to compete, exit, or something in-between (monitor). Participation is not required, and players can exit from competition if desired

Strategic Leaders operating in complex adaptive system must concern themselves with obtaining and maintaining advantage. 
- All advantages are provisional
- Organizations exist to make routine the assumptions and activities that help them succeed, and those assumptions and activities sustain success until they no longer fit the competitive environment and they become weaknesses

#### Chapter 3. Leading Large Bureaucratic Organizations: The Internal Environment

**Three is a need for bureaucracy**
- the multiple systems and processes comprising a bureaucracy are essential for the large, complex, organizations like the DoD
	- Senior leaders depend on these systems because their size and complexity preclude their ability to know every part of the organization, to interact with every employee, and to hold people personally accountable
	- direct supervision and real-time situation awareness are impossible to obtain and maintain alone
	- administrative structures and systems are necessary to distribute, coordinate, and supervise activities of the major sub-organizations within bureaucracy
- bureaucracies are impersonal, favor no one, and seek to create efficiencies for the sake of the whole organization
Strategic leaders should design and maintain bureaucratic systems that enable (not hinder) achieving strategic goals

**Organizational Tensions**
In large, complex organizations there are persistent tensions that create difficult decisions for senior leaders. Ex:
- Balancing the opportunity costs of near-term objectives against more distance goals often focuses attention on incremental process efficiencies over long term plans
	- Shown in the focus on near-term readiness at the expense of modernization efforts (provide capabilities needed now, vs capabilities needed in the future fight)
- Balancing cost, schedule, and future performance within the major defense acquisition system
- Specialized objectives of individual sub-organizations and the overall goals of the enterprise
	- Creating specialized sub-organizations requires more effort and time to integrate those units within the enterprise
	- Additional sub-organizations require additional administrative burden and may create operational redundancy 
- As the need to manage environmental complexity increases, greater effort is required from the Strategic Leader to coordinate action and outputs across subunits

**Organization Structure**
Organizational structure provides an important insight into how previous strategic leaders have though about balancing organizational tensions. Examination of the governing systems and lines of authority reflect and reinforce deliberate designs for differentiating and integrating such military activities. 

Options for designing organizational structure include
- Functional purpose (service branches, USA, USSF, USAF, USN, USMC)
- Interdependent operations (functional combatant commands, USSTRATCOM, USCYBERCOM, USTRANSCOM, USSOCOM)
- Geographic Region (USSPACECOM, USNORTHCOM, USSOUTHCOM, USEUCOM, USAFRICOM, USINDOPACOM, USCENTCOM)

Options for designing organizational decision processes
- Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE)
- Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS)
- Defense Acquisition System (DAS)
Designed as a way to align military requirements (JCIDS) with strategy, to synch Congressional authorizations and appropriations (PPBE) and to develop and maintain capability (DAS) across massive number of internal and external stakeholders.

These are example of *robust* formal standardization and consequently increased amount of bureaucracy

Within bureaucratic organizations there are *informal* structures that the Senior Leaders cannot directly design or control. Informal organizations emerge from unplanned patterns of interaction and can be significantly influenced by individuals. 

Informal relationships create social systems that affect work and how people experience it

Informal organizations are an important source of social influence by meeting psychological needs of employees by personalizing the bureaucracy, and fulfilling social needs through friendships and trust networks

Effective leadership in a bureaucracy is limited by what the formal organization enables and what the informal organization collectively supports

An indicator of strategic leadership success is the alignment between an organization's formal and informal structures. Negative cultures are typically a symptom of weak alignment between the formal and informal structures within an organization

Effective strategic leaders quickly recognize the root cause of frictions between formal and informal organizational structure and use their authority to modify the administrative aspects of the system to encourage desired behavior and organizational outcomes

**Strategic Leadership: Levers of Control**
There are four concrete ways (*levers of control*) for leaders to adapt organizations and enable change, two formal and two informal.
- Formal levers - tie behavior to specific consequences through use of control systems (rewards, punishments, or evaluations). Use of formal position power to shape operational standards and define how to measure success.
	- Boundary Levers - Change the reporting relationships, authorities, and/or the formal processes that guide operations. These changes impose or re-draw boundaries around who makes decision and how resources/rewards are allocated
		- Denying a promotion
		- Changes to formal decision support system (PPBE)
		- Issuing new doctrine/policy guidance
	- Diagnostic Levers - Change what is measured, adjusting milestones, or revising standards. Provide incentives to redirect efforts, and provide feedback about where results are not being achieved
- Informal levers - inspire people to follow rather than compel action.
	- Belief System Levers - directly address why people believe in the organization and what they believe about how it works. Leaders impact beliefs via the consistency in their own behaviors that model and communicate the core values and vision of the enterprise. By choosing to interact more around certain issues than others, leaders send direct and indirect messages about their (and organizational) priorities.
	- Interactive Lever - Refers to the idea that every action or inaction of a senior leader is interpreted by those below them in the hierarchy. Where and when strategic leaders decide to become personally involved, and what they focus on, shapes and focuses the attention of efforts across the enterprise. 

Leaders should consider the mix of levers they chose to pull. Both informal and formal levers are effective when applied appropriately. 

Senior leaders tend to often over rely on formal levers/use them in a reactionary way

Formal levers are top-down, informal levers are bottom-up control mechanisms

**Implications**
Strategic leadership of a complex system requires a depth of patience, resilience, foresight, and the character required to look beyond immediate events and to anticipate how decisions will be received by diverse stakeholders. This requires sophisticated intellectual understanding of second- and third-order consequences of decisions, and highly refined communication skills to meaningfully explain the trade-offs in decisions that may favor some groups over others yet move the enterprise toward strategic objectives.

#### Chapter 4. Competitive Strategy
Competitive systems require strategies for making choices

**Strategy - are guidelines for decision-making in conditions of competitive uncertainty, with the purpose of reducing that uncertainty and creating or maintaining an advantage**

Competitive strategies prioritize and balance contradictions over time, space, and scale. All strategy is based on expectations of a causal relationship between an action and a desired (or undesired) effect

Competitive Strategy Categories
- Deliberate or Emergent
- Direct or Indirect
- Based on Limited or Unlimited Resources
- Can involve competition based on quality, quantity, or a mix

**Ways of Competing**
- Deliberate - reflect a heroic view of competition in which leaders survey the environment and build and implement strategies. They produce an ordered result that reflects the will of the key decision-makers in an organization. Tend to be top-down or centralized
		- Controlled, conscious, and formal processes, decomposed into distinct steps
		- Place responsibility for the overall process with the chief executive
		- Produce fully-formed strategies that are implemented through detailed attentions to objectives, budgets, programs etc. 
	- Active Deliberate - Proactive and involve taking the initiative by making choices that start new chains of causation. 
	- Passive Deliberate - Reactive and involve making choices to frustrate, delay, or break the chain of causation that your adversary is budling. Tend to have less control over timing and are more reactive
- Emergent - Display unintentional order that arise from patterns of decision-maker over time, and order is not clear until after the fact. Tend to be bottom-up  or decentralized, and occur through learning
	- Assumes that the complex and dynamic nature of the organization's environment:
		- precludes deliberate control
		- strategy making must above all take the form of a process of learning over time in which at the limit formulation and implementation become indistinguishable
	- Responsibility for strategy learning and development throughout the organization - many potential strategists
	- Leaders responsible for managing a process of strategic learning
	- Finds strategies first as patterns out of the past, and only later perhaps as deliberate plans for the future
	Emergent and Deliberate strategies are not mutually exclusive and organizations use each one at distinct stages of competition

- Direct - Tend to focus within levels of national security strategy. Make the enemy helpless to resist by physically destroying their military capabilities
- Indirect - Tend to focus across levels of national strategy. Convince the enemy that accepting our terms will be less painful than continuing to aggress or resist
	- More complex and time consuming
	- Connections between cause and effect are longer with greater risks of miscalculation and error
1. Indirect strategies are most evident in a willingness to accept a competitive disadvantage at one level in pursuit of a competitive advantage at a higher level
2. One competitor can employ a direct strategy while its opponent employs an indirect strategy
3. Indirect strategies can become direct when an adversary 'levels up' its own strategy

- Strategies of Quality - Focus on differentiation seeking overmatch. Product differentiation in terms of business competition
- Strategies of Quantity - Focus on mass. Cost differentiation in terms of business competition

**Competitive Narratives**
The stories we tell about strategic competition can be as powerful as the facts themselves

At the strategic level the meaning we give to reality differs based on how we collectively interpret it - how we socially construct it

Strategy does not merely need to orchestrate tactical actions (use of force) but also construct the interpretive structure which gives them meaning and links them to the end of policy

Leaders get influence, if not outright define, the meaning of reality. Recognizing the constructive possibilities of strategy can dramatically expand strategic choice and give rise to more creative strategies

The social construction of knowledge means that the social environment, with its relationships, culture, norms, and values, significantly influences how we understand the world, and how we understand the world affects what we know to be true

In a socially constructed context, a leader has maneuver space to shape the meaning of facts, and therefore transform our understanding of reality.

Transforming leaders do not change the facts; they change what the facts mean by constructing new possibilities

Though leaders cannot, on their own, successfully advance a strategic narrative, they have freedom to create and preserve options domestically and internationally by creatively interpreting established facts.

**Conclusion**
Effective organizational leadership is the essential condition of competitive success
